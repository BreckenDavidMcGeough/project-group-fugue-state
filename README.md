# Gig App Web Application

## The Gig App

Trello scrum board link: [link](https://trello.com/b/u26rWGdl/cse-442-project-pmzuhra-team-b)

This was a collaborative effort between myself and four outher students for CSE442:Software Engineering. We built a web application called 'The Gig App', which was oriented around musicians and artists. The web app was engineered using PHP, SQL, HTML, Javascript, and CSS. It was hosted on Apache web server and utilizes a MySQL database to store user information, music, and more. We learned many skills throughout the construction of this project, including working with and constructing relational databases, hosting code on a web server, and working collaboratively on github. We had a project manager who would assign sprints, where we used a scrum board called Trello (Trello.com) to allocate tasks and rigourosly and thoroughly document tasks in each phase of completion. We had strict development standards and deadlines for each sprint. In the end, our project was nominated for best project and we were given a chance to present it infront of other professors and graduate students. This is a list of some of the key functionality of the site:

* Create an account and personalize it

* Construct, edit, and save sheet music with lyrics

* Share music you have created with other users and view their music

* Search for artists, songs, and genres and view them

* Customize profile based on preferred generes and get recommendations

This is a fork of my group project from CSE442. My alternate github account (breckenmcgeough) linked to my UB email address is associated with this project (breckenm@buffalo.edu|breckenmcgeough).
